                        <p>  Food Schmood is a full-stack food delivery application that is coded using Java Spark, MongoDB Atlas, and MithrilJS. 
                             It uses REST API endpoints
                             to send HTTPS requests to the backend, for various use cases such as ordering food from a restaurant, adding 
                             a new customer, contacting drivers associated to orders, and such. The current frontend of the application has limited
                             functionality, but the API endpoints are ready to go.   The project was designed and planned efficiently in periods of two-week sprints using the Agile methodology.

                        <p>
                            HuskyHub is an iOS application coded on React Native and ExpoCLI. HuskyHub is built exclusively for Northeastern University Seattle. 
                            The motivation behind the application was to allow students
                            to make connections with their peers, within the Seattle campus. It also allows promoting events such as workshops, meetups and independent student activities. 
                            The application is built on the basis of the Don Norman Principles of Interaction Design, keeping beautiful, efficient and user friendly UI in mind. 
                            In order to make the application most efficient, the team also conducted various stages of user interviews and user testing. The current application is to be expanded 
                            as a group project within the Women in Tech community of NU Seattle.

                        <p>
                            Scriber is a fully managed, serverless note taking application that is built on React and AWS Lambda Functions. It also uses the Stripe payment API to 
                            manage secure payments on a need-for-demand basis. Scriber uses AWS Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool for user authentication and stores the user data using AWS DynamoDB and S3. 
                            It also uses REST API requests at various endpoints. 
                            Scriber is currently under construction.
